        <h1>Hello my name is Nick Surgent</h1>
            <p>When I graduate, I would like to find a job involved in cyber security or software design.</p>
            <p>I previously worked with some video game companies like Riot Games, so I would enjoy finding something
                in the same field or working with a local company like UPMC.</p>
            <p>Out of everything we've done so far with applied computer science, I found the programming to be the most interesting 
               and though we have not been that involved with it, I personally find cyber security exciting.</p>
